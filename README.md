## Application Details:
Our app was a Mystery Number Challenge game created with React Native using the coding language of Typescript. 
The game had to enable the user to enter a random number between 1 and 100. The user is expected to enter their guess. 
After entering the guess, the user should click the button to see if it displays the correct result.  

# Design Considerations 
The app was designed with an easy-to-navigate user interface which offers the user a smooth and intuitive user experience.   
It was designed in a way that it's able to function on different screen sizes without giving any issues.   
It is compatible on different sizes. 
The design of the app is simple, without any complexity that overwhelm the user.  


# Features
- Applied useState for dynamic state management
- Used control structures (if statements,) for feedback logic
- Built and tested with Expo Go 


# Key learning points
We dedicated more time to practising in Visual Studio, which significantly deepened our understanding of different coding approaches. 
This hands-on experience not only improved our technical skills but also helped us recognise which methods were most effective for our project.

# Challenges and Solutions
Working as a team of four enabled us to divide responsibilities effectively and share valuable insights throughout the development process. Collaborating closely allowed us to generate ideas for coding the application, manage tasks more efficiently, and ultimately build it at a faster pace.
One of the challenges we faced was pushing the project to GitHub. To resolve this, we watched a tutorial on [https://youtu.be/JB7YD7OKm5g?si=I5hkumTksePki5vK] which guided us through the process. 
When we encountered errors in the game code, we reviewed examples from class, which helped us identify and fix several issues.
 we opted for if-then statements, which provided a simpler and more reliable solution for the application
